\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{Sincast} object}

\item{assay}{Which \code{Seurat} assay to use. Default is the default \code{Seurat} assay.}

\item{features}{Features to impute. Default is all features in the assay.}

\item{npcs}{How many principal components to compute on the query data. The PCs will be used to construct the knn graph.}

\item{t}{Diffusion time, or the power of Markov transition matrix.}

\item{k}{The number of neighbors used to infer adaptive Gaussian kernel for each cell.}

\item{knn}{A cell can only be connected to knn neighbors when t is set 1.}

\item{do.umap.dist}{Logical: if TRUE, scale Euclidean distances to distances beyond nearest neighbors as in the UMAP algorithm.}

\item{a}{Default: log2(k) and log(k/(k-1)) when setting umap.dist to TRUE and FALSE respectively.
a < 1 represents the probability of a cell communicating with its kth nearest neighbor.
a > 1 represents the sum of probabilities of a cell communicating with its k nearest neighbors.}

\item{do.laplacian}{Logical: if TRUE, perform Laplacian normalization on the affinity matrix.}

\item{norm}{How to symmetrize the affinity matrix. Default is Probabilistic t-norm. The other option is 'average'.}
}
\value{
